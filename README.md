PortScanner
===========

This utility saves your time if you need to verify port open on remote host. It support both TCP and UDP protocols.

Installation.
Just run PortScanner.exe file, no installation required.

Usage.
Create text file with hostnames, each on new line. Use can use either FQDN or IP addresses.

Issues.
I didn't implement yet threading so UI can stuck during scan process. I'll fix it soon.
